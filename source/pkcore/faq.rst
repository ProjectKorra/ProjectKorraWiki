How can I report a bug?
=======================

ProjectKorra Core bugs can be reported `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/forums/core-support.67/>`_.

As of ProjectKorra Core v1.5.0, there is a debug feature built into the plugin.
This will help us a ton when you submit a bug report if you include the debug.txt
created when you use the /bending debug command in addition to a log of your console
if it shows a visible error. Debug will help us by listing ProjectKorra plugins and
dependencies so that we can isolate the source of the problem. This speeds up the
bug fixing process A LOT.
